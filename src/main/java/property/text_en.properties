about01=This site is intended for correspondence students of BNTU who need help in performing <strong>tests</strong>, as well as for students seeking <strong> consultation </strong> in preparation for the exam.
about02=Examination is the main means of monitoring the knowledge and effectiveness of educational activities when studying at the correspondence department of the Belarusian National Technical University (BNTU). In the period between sessions, the correspondence student is invited to complete a series of tests in various disciplines. The implementation of such work requires a large amount of time and effort, which not every extramural student can afford. If for some reason you can not or do not have time to complete the test work - contact a specialist. <a href="do?command=contact">Contact us</a> - order your tests to be completed and be sure of their correctness and timeliness. If you completed the work yourself, but doubt its correctness, order a solution only for those tasks you are not sure about, this will allow you to understand the course of the solution and save your time. <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Also, during the session, the correspondence student must pass a number of exams and tests in the subjects studied. If you doubt your abilities, we will assist in preparing and passing exams. <a href="do?command=contact">Contact us</a> and request help for your exams! <br> <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp We are a group of graduates working strictly in their field of knowledge, without intermediaries and subcontractors. Work experience with BNTU students - more than 15 years. <br> <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The names of teaching aids, examples of solutions and current prices can be found on our website. If you have not found your teaching aid for which you need to perform the test work - anyway, <a href="do?command=contact">call or write to us</a>!
